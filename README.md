## NOG Talks

### Ben Harpt - Quantum Computing with Individual Electrons

Computers built from bits that harness the properties of quantum physics have potential to solve problems that regular computers cannot. 
In recent years, prototype quantum computers have grown rapidly more capable thanks to progress in physics and engineering. 
Still, programming quantum computers to solve real-world problems remains a distant goal that depends largely on engineering the right hardware. 
In this NOGS talk, I explain how individual electron spins in semiconductors can be controlled and used as quantum bits to encode information. 
In broad strokes, I show how to prepare, manipulate, and read out these so-called spin qubits. 
I also highlight active research fronts in the quest to scale single qubits into functional quantum computers.

### Aedan Gardill - Nanoscale Metrology with Nitrogen Vacancy Centers in Diamond

Nanoscale metrology has applications in fields ranging from industrial fabrication to biophysics to the study of complex condensed matter systems. 
Our group is developing novel sensing techniques with the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center defect in diamond to enable local measurements of material properties and dynamics at the nanometer scale. 
Understanding the origins of decoherence in NVs is vital to unlocking their full potential for metrology. 
I will present recent work in which we have shed light on some of the NV decoherence sources intrinsic to diamond. 
These results bring us a step closer to using NVs to investigate the nature of decoherence in other quantum systems, such as solid-state qubit platforms.
