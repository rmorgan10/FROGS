# Welcome to FROGS!

FROG Seminars are organized by the [Physics Graduate Student Council](https://pgsc.physics.wisc.edu/) to showcase the fantastic research of the graduate students in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Physics Department.
The talks are accessible to anyone with an introductory physics knowledge, and they are a great jumping off point to find research that interests you.
Find the sign-up link, the upcoming schedule, and abstracts below, and feel free to contact members of the PGSC with questions.

## Upcoming Talk Abstracts

### Greg Loges - Slogging through the Swampland

The Landscape of quantum gravity-derivable theories is surrounded on all sides by a vast, quantum gravity-incompatible Swampland. 
The aim of the Swampland program is to understand those features which can be used to distinguish these two different regions. 
In this talk I will give a brief introduction to recent progress in our understanding of quantum gravity and its implications for low-energy physics. 
I will focus on the weak gravity conjecture and present an overview of our recent work in which we use black hole thermodynamics to understand the role of symmetries in demonstrating the conjecture.

### Brent Mode - Developing the Prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope for the Cherenkov Telescope Array

As they speed through the Earth’s atmosphere, very high energy gamma rays have the potential to collide with an air molecule, setting off cascades of particle interactions which are detectable from a characteristic blue glow called Cherenkov light. 
While these interactions occur on much too short a time scale and produce light too faint for the human eye to observe, a breadth of science analyses become possible using a specially designed telescope with a powerful camera. 
My work at UW-Madison is focused on the development and commissioning of one such camera for the prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (pSCT) as part of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array. 
I will describe the specifications of this novel instrument, the contributions I’ve made to the pSCT’s development, and touch on the science that will be possible once the pSCT is completed.
