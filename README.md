# Welcome to FROGS!

FROG Seminars are organized by the [Physics Graduate Student Council](https://pgsc.physics.wisc.edu/) to showcase the fantastic research of the graduate students in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Physics Department.
The talks are accessible to anyone with an introductory physics knowledge, and they are a great jumping off point to find research that interests you.
Find the sign-up link, the upcoming schedule, and abstracts below, and feel free to contact members of the PGSC with questions.

## Upcoming Talk Abstracts

### Brent Mode - Developing the Prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope for the Cherenkov Telescope Array

As they speed through the Earth’s atmosphere, very high energy gamma rays have the potential to collide with an air molecule, setting off cascades of particle interactions which are detectable from a characteristic blue glow called Cherenkov light. 
While these interactions occur on much too short a time scale and produce light too faint for the human eye to observe, a breadth of science analyses become possible using a specially designed telescope with a powerful camera. 
My work at UW-Madison is focused on the development and commissioning of one such camera for the prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (pSCT) as part of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array. 
I will describe the specifications of this novel instrument, the contributions I’ve made to the pSCT’s development, and touch on the science that will be possible once the pSCT is completed.

### Trevor Oxholm - You’re Gonna Go Far, KID: cosmology with superconducting Kinetic Inductance Detectors on balloon- and space-based missions

Sub-millimeter astronomy is entering a new frontier. 
Earth’s atmosphere plagues ground-based sub-mm telescopes with high levels of background radiation, so astronomers are relocating their instruments to high-altitude balloons, and in the near future, onto satellites.
This new era of low-background sub-mm astronomy requires highly sensitive detector technologies, for which we turn to superconductivity. 
The Kinetic Inductance Detector (KID), a superconducting microresonator technology that has only recently seen its first light, is being commissioned for this new generation of instruments. 
The EXperiment for Cryogenic Large-Aperture Intensity Mapping (EXCLAIM), led by NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center scientists, is among the first in this class of instruments. 
I will describe the technology behind KIDs designed for EXCLAIM, and the science we plan to accomplish. 
I will also describe the potential for the use of KIDs in future space missions, along with the science that can be accomplished with such a low-background, highly sensitive survey of the cosmos.
